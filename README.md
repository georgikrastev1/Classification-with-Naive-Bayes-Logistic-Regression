# Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-Logistic-Regression
In this assignment, we will implement multiclass classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes via the Scikit-learn library.

In Part A of this assignment, we are going to implement Logistic Regression. First, we are going to examine how data 
scaling affects the performance of the classifier: We will produce a classification report and plot a confusion matrix. 
We are then going to use cross validation to more reliably compare the performance of the models.

In Part B of this assignment, we are going to implement multiclass and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
We are going to perform feature selection and analyse the performance of the model. 
Finally, we are also going to look at decision boundaries.

We are going to work with two datasets:
- The 'Gene expression cancer RNA-Seq' dataset 
- The 'Zoo' dataset.
